# Introduction to dataset

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs). The data can be accessed here [links](https://github.com/the_graph_courses/pbb_q4_2024_materials/raw/refs/heads/main/week_04_workshop/data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.zip) and more information on  the data can be accessed here [links](https://zenodo.org/records/5014153).


```{python}
# Load the data set
india_tb = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/ester.nepolo.GFP-PMU/Desktop/Desktop 2024/My Courses/Python/graph_courses_python/week_04_workshop/data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv')

itables.show(india_tb)

# Study setting

The map provides an overview of the state of Tamil Nadu in India, by administrative districts. Vellore district where the study was conducted is located in the north-east.

# Age distribution of TB patients by Sex

This plot shows the age distribution of TB patients, normalized as a percentage, disaggregated by sex.

Key observations:

- For younger age groups (20-40), there is a higher proportion of 
  female TB patients lkcompared to males.
- In the 40-60 age range, the percentage of male TB patients increases significantly,
  overtaking females, especially noticeable around ages 50-60.
- At older ages (around 70+), the proportion becomes nearly 100% male, indicating that
  female representation drops significantly in these age groups.

This visualization highlights the gender differences in TB prevalence across different age groups, with males being more dominant in older age groups and females being more common in younger age groups.


```{python}
age_sex_plot = px.histogram(india_tb, x="Age", color="Sex", barnorm="percent", text_auto=".0f",

# Highlights of key numbers
```{python}
# Average health systems delay
average_hs_delay = int(round(india_tb['Health sys delay (in days)'].mean(), 0))

# Average treatment initiation delay
average_treatment_delay = int(round(india_tb['Treatment initiation delay (in days)'].mean(), 0))

```

Due to Health Systems delays, on average TB patients wait for about `{python} average_hs_delay` days before they are diagnosed.
Once they are dignosed, it takes them an average of `{python} average_treatment_delay` days to be initiated on TB treatment.
